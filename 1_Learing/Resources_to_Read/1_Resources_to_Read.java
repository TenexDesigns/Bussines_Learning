To be a successful businessman, you need to have a good understanding of running businesses, corporate governance, financial systems, technology, and government influence on businesses. You also need to be able to operate corporate companies and manage finances and operations.

In addition to the above, I recommend that you read business magazines and newspapers, such as The Economist, Forbes, and Inc. You should also attend industry events and conferences to network with other businesspeople and learn about the latest trends and developments.

It is also important to find a mentor or coach who can guide you and help you learn from their experience.

Finally, don't be afraid to fail. Failure is a natural part of the learning process. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward.

I hope this helps!
